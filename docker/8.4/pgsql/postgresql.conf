## Minimal postgresql.conf template for runtime configuration
## Values can be substituted via environment variables using envsubst.

# Listen on all interfaces so other containers can connect using service name
listen_addresses = '*'

# Port can be configured via PG_PORT env (Compose maps PG_PORT -> postgres port)
port = ${PG_PORT:-5432}

# Memory / connection tuning (examples)
max_connections = ${POSTGRES_MAX_CONNECTIONS:-100}
shared_buffers = ${POSTGRES_SHARED_BUFFERS:-128MB}

# Logging
logging_collector = on
log_directory = 'log'
log_filename = 'postgresql-%a.log'

# Make sure SSL is not required by default (let host/ingress handle TLS)
ssl = off

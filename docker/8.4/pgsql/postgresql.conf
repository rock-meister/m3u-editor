## Minimal postgresql.conf template for runtime configuration
## Values can be substituted via environment variables using envsubst.

# Listen on all interfaces so other containers can connect using service name
listen_addresses = '*'

# Port is provided via PG_PORT environment variable (set in compose)
port = ${PG_PORT}

# Memory / connection tuning (examples)
max_connections = ${POSTGRES_MAX_CONNECTIONS}
shared_buffers = ${POSTGRES_SHARED_BUFFERS}

# Logging
logging_collector = on
log_directory = 'log'
log_filename = 'postgresql-%a.log'

# Make sure SSL is not required by default (let host/ingress handle TLS)
ssl = off
